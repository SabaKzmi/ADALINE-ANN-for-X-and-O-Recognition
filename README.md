# ADALINE ANN for X and O Recognition
This project implements an ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can recognize X and O characters on a 5x5 grid. The user interface, built with customTKinter, allows users to create, label, and add data for training, as well as test the ANN by drawing on the grid.
## Adaptive Linear Neuron (ADALINE)
The project implements an ADALINE ANN, which uses linear activation functions and updates weights based on the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm. Weights and biases are initialized randomly. The project includes a feature to check the accuracy of the ANN using a separate dataset.
## User Interface
The project's UI was implemented in customTKinter, allowing users to create and label X and O data on a 5x5 grid, train the ANN, and test its recognition capabilities in separate tabs.
